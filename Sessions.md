We go deeper into apis

1. Sending data from frontend

	- We send two cards - post action - to node api

	- Node api asks rules api, sends cards to rules api for decision
2. We get a response from rules api in node api

3. Then node api sends that back to frontend

4. Frontend shows response: ace bigger than jack


- U will build apis to do this action,  and all code involved in both apis

- All this is overhead, nodeapi could decide cards weight

  But its actually a fun test to see more apis involved in one call

- And usually la orice firma veti avea 100% more than one api to work with

  More like, at least about 7 of em, unde lucrez eu is 35

- O sa vorbim si despre project management nitel
	- Splitting of concerns/logic

- Going deeper into 'Serverless'
