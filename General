1) complete the winforms requirement u got today, so that you complete that app

2) update CV cu AWS Lambda/ API Gateway knowledge: 
    2.a) finish the serverless / lambda hello world function in the link I gave you
    2.b) with that knowledge, make aniother AWS lambda function to serve your static html header
    2.c) call and inject the html header in all your websites, so that you got the same header everywhere

3) complete NBA App

============================

1) stuff you can do yourself now:
1.a) JS course
1.b) the Homies class exercise
1.c) send me the current status of nba app si iti dau eu exercitii doable, cu complexitate graduala so that you can actually do them.


2) stuff you will pause for now:
2.a) pause winforms app (needs 1.b as prerequisite first, to be able to advance with winforms app)
2.b) pause aws lambda (needs an intro in one of our lessons, ca nu e ceva tocmai usor)
2.c) pause main site header (needs practice with aws lambda first - 2.b as prerequisite)
2.d) pause react course for now, pt ca it morphed into a redux course, and you need to feel more comfortable cu prima parte a cursului aluia, cea de react, before u dive into redux
